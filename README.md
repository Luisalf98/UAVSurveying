# UAV Surveying Project developed in C++

Technologies: C++, ROS (Robot Operating System), Catkin.

This project integrates Ublox GNSS ZED-F9P, VectorNav VN-200 INS and Livox Horizon LIDAR sensors to do UAV Surveying.

I cloned the repository from https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_high_precision_mapping and changed it, so it can work with my sensors. Additionally, I integrated a Nextion HMI touchscreen to the project for GNSS/INS data visualization. There is a button on the screen for playing/stopping surveys.
